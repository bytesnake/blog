Dancing was one of the things that kept me mentally sane in 2020. Because Lindy Hop is not possible at the moment, we shifted to choreographies and friends organized weekly meetings where we could meet online and learn them together.

Here are my four favorite choreographies:

## Trickeration

fast, very musical, a lot of fun

## Big Apple

insanely long, funny movements, bridges

## Shim-Sham

classic, tons of variations, good for circles

## Little Brown Jug

I couldn't find a recorded video of the choreography, but a portuguese guy taught it through an online course. The song is called `Little Brown Jug`
