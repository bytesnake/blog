The following script does:\n\nlook into .thunderbird/c9rt7s6i.default-release/ImapMail/groupware.fau.de/INBOX.msf and counts the number of mails\nif no new mail arrived writes M: &lt;unread&gt;/&lt;total&gt; into /tmp/mail_counter\nif new emails arrived colors the output in green\n\n\nAfter putting it to a reachable location (for me it is ~/.local/bin/check-email.sh) and making the script executable, add a new crontab rule with $ crontab -e and decide how often you want to look this up:\n\nYou know have to add a section to your i3 status bar for this file:\n\nwhich looks in every update cycle into your generated file. And voilà you have an email counter in you status bar.\n\nStart thunderbird in headless mode during login\nI don’t want to have thunderbird open all the time, but then the script doesn’t work anymore. Unfortunately there is no way to mix headless and GUI mode in thunderbird, so I wrote a small wrapper which does this:\n\nIt basically looks up the PID of headless thunderbird and kills it, then starts in GUI mode and afterwards restarts it into headless mode. I put this script to /usr/local/bin/thunderbird so that it overwrites the default path.\nYou still have to start thunderbird in headless mode during login, I extended my ~/.profile with\n\nand you should be good to go.\n","id":"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/i3-mail/","title":"Preview unread/total number of emails in i3status"},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/notes/":{"body":"I wrote a new iteration of my note system during a week vacation from home. Motivated with two recent observations, that the system I want to built is actually a static note generator, and that Mastodon is a good fit for publishing and reviewing notes, I created a tool called ztl.\n\nThe website you’re currently reading is generated with something called a static website generator, in this case the excellent zola tool. Its main feature is that everything is compiled once into a set of static files, which can be served to the reader with a simple HTTP endpoint.\nThe equivalent for a note taking system is a static note generator. It takes a all files in a subfolder, generates linked notes from them and saves the artifact in a simple format (here TOML) for downstream use. The artifact has three characteristics, it is\nrendered   the note content is rendered into a universal format, here HTML together with MathML for displaying formulae.\nlinked   from the artifact parent note, outgoing links and incoming links are readily available for navigating to relevant content\nspanned   span for each source file provides an overlay we can use for editors to display inline information when viewing\nI recently had a whole week vacation at home and built such a tool which can (1) render a folder into notes (2) do a live-preview of the content (3) publish them to a Mastodon instance\n\nAll the formats I need\nThere are two modes of writing which are irreconcilable for me. The first I use for prose text, the second for scientific notation. As I’m comfortable with LaTeX and don’t want to miss out on the ams* packages, I opted for markdown and LaTeX.\nIn side-by-side comparison the syntax for markdown,\n\nand the syntax for LaTeX with theorem blocks, custom commands and operators,\n\nBoth versions highlight how to define two nested notes. In Markdown the ID and title are implicitely define by convention of the header, while in LaTeX they are made explicit through the key definitions of the blocks. Nesting is also implicitely defined in Markdown. If the header level is larger, then the note is defined as the child of the previous one. On the other hand, in LaTeX this is explicit by nesting two blocks in each other and having indentation for better readability.\nFurther linking to other notes is done with simple hyperrefs in markdown syntax, while in LaTeX I have a custom command \\r{&lt;label&gt;}{&lt;target&gt;} for that.\nThe Markdown version is much easier to read and less poluted by special commands, while the LaTeX version is much more flexible with custom commands and mathematical notation.\nFor conversion I use the comrak crate for Markdown, and the excellent TeX4ht for LaTeX. Before passing the note to each processor, I extract it from previous and following notes. This is especially important for LaTeX, as it makes the compilation process much faster.\nAs references can only point within a note set, I need a third file format for bibliography notes. Of course, I use the established bibtex and support a third file format with *.bib. BibTeX are currently not rendered to HTML and instead silently dropped when published to Mastodon. They support a file key though and additional metadata which is shown in Vim.\n\nWatching changes with Sixel characters\nBecause the LaTeX format is so complicated, I need live preview when writing notes.\nThe Sixel format defines an ASCII standard for printing graphics to terminal emulators. Many emulators are supporting this already, you can find a complete list at Are we Sixel yet?. I use a patches version of Alacritty.\nFurther, I recently found out that TMux also supports Sixel in their latest version. This is awesome, because it means I can create a split pane with editor on one side, live preview on the other side on a remote server. When I want to continue working on notes, I can just re-attach the session from any computer.\nIn total this looks like this (rendering with headless chromium)\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\tFigure 1.\n\t\tPreview of ztl tool\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nToots and Notes\nWhen reading things up, it would be great to have notes available on the browser or on smartphone.\nBecause we already have rendered HTML in our compiled note set, publishing notes to Mastodon is simple. For ztl there is a subcommand ztl publish, which toots new notes, edits already existing if their content changed and deletes old notes on the Mastodon instance. Tooting is driven by the toot Mastodon CLI tool.\nTo work properly I had to customize one instance with larger character size (HTML can be pretty long), and allow the MathML tags.\nMastodon fits nicely because\n\nparent notes are just toots which we reply to and rendered in threading mode\nmemos can be attached to notes and collected with an apropriate hashtag\nchanges of toots are available and displayed similar like Git differences\n\nIn total, a threaded note view looks like this\n\n\nComments on Rust\nRust is a natural fit for text processing command line tools. It is fast, expressive and has excellent tooling for development.\nNo suprise for used crates, I have clap for argument parsing, use serde for TOML processing and anyhow for error wrapping. Further I used scraper for HTML post-processing and comrak for Markdown processing. The TeX4ht tools are directly called as an external binary, same for the Mastodon integration. The development process felt super straightforward and pretty rewarding for me.\nParsed note information has the following structure and are collected into .ztl/cache/&lt;key&gt; files in TOML format\n\nI will extend on the technical side a bit, once I found time to improve documentation of the repository.\n\nWrapping up\nIn summary I’m very happy with the current iteration of ztl. It is persistent through terminal multiplexing, powerful enough to encode any content and simple enough that it can be extended in future iterations.\nFuther, I can work through text with modal editing, while at the same time read on any computer or smartphone in this world.\n","id":"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/notes/","title":"Writing notes like it's (almost) 2025"},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/reading-vimhelp/":{"body":"I thought that I should improve my vim skills this morning and started by reading the vim help pages. I skimmed them in the past a couple of times, but actually learned most of the keys by doing.\n\nMy motivation was improving the gf command, which automatically opens the file under the cursor in a new buffer. Normally this fails if the file does not exists, but can be remapped with noremap gf :e &lt;cfile&gt;&lt;cr&gt;. I then tried to create a group for auto-creating a subfolder where the current buffer path points and found the following snippets:\n\nThis works with :M now, but I can’t combine it by doing :Me &lt;cfile&gt;&lt;cr&gt; 😕 I then thought that I need to learn more of vim and am looking now at the help pages. Looking at the page vimhelp/usr_02.txt.html shows a really insightful and useful way of teaching.\nThis is a simp!!!\n\nLearned modifiers\n\nuse J to join the current and next line\nreplace last character with combination $ x a, different to what I’m used to by doing A &lt;backspace&gt;\nuse ~ to change the case of a character and move to the next one\n\n\nUsing counts\nI used counts before for search with f/F, but you can actually use it for navigating and repeating written stuff as well.\nYou can use 9A !&lt;ESC&gt; to write nine times the exclamation mark at the end of the line.\nYou can use 3o Repeat&lt;ESC&gt; to create three lines with “Repeat” written\nYou can navigate to the third line under the cursor with 3j\nYou can jump to the end of the third line with 3$\nThe cool thing about the last discovery is that I can use that in my web-browser as well, because I’m using a vim plugin xD\n\nForward search for matching pair\nThe % modifier will search for the matching pair of a bracket. For example a expression like (a == (b * c) / d) will cause % under the first character to jump the last character, which is the matching pair :)\nThis is especially useful in visual mode to select everything between brackets.\n\nNavigating\nI previously used :35 to jump into the 35th line, but with counts you I can also just do 35G\nRelative jumps may also become handy if you are seeing a line at the beginning and you want to jump there, you can do:\n\nH for jumping at the beginning of the page\nM for jumping to the middle\nL for jumping to the end\n\nIf you doing jumps in the text, you can reverse those jumps with CTRL-O or repeat them with CTRL-I. The latter on does not work in my configuration and I have no clue why :D\n\nCentering the current line\nYou can bring the current line to the top, middle or bottom of the screen with zt, zz, zb. During presentation or showing someone something inside of vim, it may be useful to hide unrelevant information above the current section.\n\nUsing marks\nMarks are a special syntax for remembering up to 26 (a-z) sections in your text. You can set a mark “a” with ma and then jump to the line with 'a. With '' you can jump to the last line, which is just a special mark “’” you can see in the whole list at :marks\nThe special marks are:\n\n“’”: The cursor position before doing a jump\n“”“: The cursor position when last editing the file\n“[”: Start of the last change\n“]”: End of the last change\n\n\nSearching\n\nuse \\&lt; and \\&gt; to mark the end of a word during searching\nuse # to search backward for the current word under the cursor\n\n\nBuffers\n\nyou can fast switch between open buffers with CTRL 6\n\nAnother useful thing for buffers is the use of automatically splitting when\nopen a new buffer. By prepending s before a buffer command a new split is\nautomatically created. Other commands I didn’t know:\n\nuse :bf to jump to first buffer\nuse :bl to jump to last buffer\nuse :ba to open all buffers in splitted screens\nuse :ls to list all buffer, e.g. unlisted ones too\n\nLet say you want to filter you buffer list for a specific file name, then\nyou can use:\n\nto filter for all files with the juggle pattern.\n\nFolding\nYou can collapse items with the operator zf. It accepts paragraphs, lines and words.\n\nzf: create a new fold at that position\nzo: open the fold\nzc: close the fold\nzr: reduce the folding\nzm: more folding\nzd: delete folding\n\nTo store and re-load the folds, use :mkview and :loadview\n","id":"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/reading-vimhelp/","title":"Reading the vim help files"},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/recipes/":{"body":"","id":"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/recipes/","title":""},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/recipes/coconut-curry/":{"body":"Schäle Zwiebel, Knoblauch und Süßkartoffeln.

My choice of language for such\ninfrastructure heavy task is Rust and I looked\ninto ways how to deploy an inference model.\nIt turned out that the process for creating a\nstandalone binary in Rust is pretty simple. Even\nbetter, wrapping a model pre-trained on a large\nevent classification dataset is possible.\nThis means that in the end I could just copy the\nbinary to any x86 machines and run them, without\nthe need to setup virtual environments or install\nany packages.\nIn this post I will demonstrate how to convert a\npre-trained model to ONNX and put it into a\nbinary. Our goal is to create a standalone\nexecutable taking samples from stdin and\nclassifying them into 527 known audio classes.\n\nONNX and audio pattern recognition\nThe Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is an open\nstandard for machine learning interoperability. It\nprovides the definitions to export the compute\ngraph of a machine learning model and consumer can\nimplement the main operators for a specific\narchitecture.\nIn our case we the excellent EfficientAT model, pre-trained\non AudioSet and compressed into smaller CNN\narchitectures. Exporting a model to an ONNX file\nis simple enough.\nWe first load the model mn10_as with acceptable\nperformance\n\nand then use the ONNX export of PyTorch to save\nour compute graph to efficientat.onnx:\n\nThis attributes melspec to the input of mel\nspectrogram features and logits for our 527\nlogits we use for classification. It further\ndefines two dynamic axis to vary the number of\nbatches and frames for inference (number of\nchannels and features are fixed though and\ncorrespond to mel filterbanks).\n\nStandalone inference\nWith the exported model we can hop to a new Rust\nbinary and install the x86_64 MUSL toolchain.\n\nTo actually load our ONNX model for inference we\nuse the excellent tract crate provided by Sonos.\n\nand do a test load of our ONNX model:\n\nWe then compile with the MUSL target\n\nand, voila, have a standalone binary without any\ndependencies\n\n\nFeeding and Filterbank\nThe remaining part is mainly diligence work. We\nneed to implement a Mel filterbank producing same\nfeatures as the PyTorch implementation and feed it\nto our model.\nTo match the same implementation, I first export\nthe Mel filterbank and STFT windows from PyTorch\nto npy files.\nThen I implement a struct which first performs the\nSTFT with our custom window and then converts the\ncomplex frequency coefficients into a Mel features\nwith our custom filterbank.\n\nFor the full implementation take a look here.\n\nImprove memory allocation performance characteristics\nI found that the model performed poorly for the\nMUSL target. My immediate suspect was the memory\nallocator and indeed the malloc implementation\nof MUSL can be pretty slow.\nInstead I added the mimalloc allocator by Microsoft\nto my project\n\nand register it at the top of my main file\n\nand the performance problems were gone.\n\nPutting it all together\nWhat remains to be done? We need to read samples\nfrom some input stream and associate the resulting\nlogits to pre-defined classes of our model.\nAs the dataset is multi-label I just sort them by\ntheir evidence and print the top 10 classes for\nthe input.\nAdd the hound crate for reading WAV files to f32\nvectors\n\nand combine with our feature extractor and model\n\n","id":"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/rust-inference/","title":"Building standalone model binaries for audio inference"},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/self-modifying/":{"body":"One of the interesting, and hard aspect of calisthenics, is the ability to\nprogress1 between movements in many different ways.\nIn contrast to classical weight training, the target is not being able to lift\na certain amount of weight over a certain amount of repetitions – but being\nable to move into a position and hold for some time.\n1\nClassical axes of movements are divided into pulling vs. pushing and\nvertically vs. horizontally. For example, handstand is a vertical pushing\nmovement.\n\nI was recently loooking for ways to track exercise progressions long-term. As I\nfound existing applications not customizable enough for my needs, I instead\nimplemented a simple interval timer. What set it aparts from others, is that\nexecutions is sourced from TOML files. Especially for\nintra-exercise progressions, I found a self-modifying pattern useful, where\nconfiguration keys can act on themselves.\n\nTo keep implementation complexity low, I’ve written a small, static webapp,\nwhere you can upload a set of exercises of TOML files. It then executes them\nand offers a progressed version at the end, for the next session.\nFor example, the Tuck Lever exercise is defined with a header of\n\nThis renders a simple start screen with all information needed:\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tFigure 1.\n\t\t\n    Example start screen for the Tuck Front Lever exercise.

Some consists of simple on-off phases, others have multi-stage\nexercises, again other progress in changing the movement altogether. To\naccommodate all of these possible progressions, I quickly realized that no\nbuilt-in system would suffice.\nInstead, I moved the programmatic part from the webapp to the configuration\nfile, and described the possible progression actions as fields with associated\nJS snippets. The file acts on itself, is hence self-modifying.\nAgain for the Tuck Front Lever, we have only a single action, that of\ndecreasing pause between sets:\n\nAfter the exercises ends, you can select whether to progress, or not:\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tFigure 2.\n\t\t Finish screen for Tuck Front Lever progression.\n'Decrease Pause' executes associated snippets and modifies the configuration\nfile.

At that time we just moved because of the end of our studies. I was not in the best of my moods (Corona, winter depression, missing closeness, a lot of changes, no job etc.) but the weather respected that at the day. It was the kind of gloominess in the morning you can see, with big clouds of fogs hanging over the landscape and brightness enough for contours but not much else. I brought an episode of the Listening Service with me. I never actively listened to Shostakovich but already heard his name in a different context. It was therefore time to look him up on Spotify. I listened a while to his string quartets and the second one in minor key was No.8 in C Minor.\nThe first piece is in tempo Largo and uses his signature motif DSCH (Dimitrie Schostakovich, like BACH) throughout. It starts like a fugue’s exposition part where the motif sounds in each voice successively. The middle part introduces a very menacing/dark motif (like somebody is knocking) directly after restating the main motif and plays it along a happy tune. The third part tries to resume the happy tune but after a few notes continues to a creepy mixture of minor/major chords and the whole musical picture feels off from there on. The part ends with the knocking motif. (just repeating, found a much better analysis here)\nDuring listening I got goosebumps all over and was probably in the perfect mood for it. Afterwards descriptions are like pure lethargy, subconscious threat, distressing, off-setting etc. but I can’t really reproduce that feeling now. It is certain to say that Shostakovich was also not in his best mood ..\nSupplement: I just found a Wikipedia article on the eighth quartet:\n\nThe piece was written shortly after Shostakovich reluctantly joined the Communist Party. According to the score, it is dedicated “to the victims of fascism and the war”; his son Maxim interprets this as a reference to the victims of all totalitarianism, while his daughter Galina says that he dedicated it to himself, and that the published dedication was imposed by the Russian authorities. Shostakovich’s friend, Lev Lebedinsky, said that Shostakovich thought of the work as his epitaph and that he planned to commit suicide around this time. Peter J. Rabinowitz has also pointed to covert references to Richard Strauss’s Metamorphosen in the Eighth Quartet.\n\n","id":"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/sombre-song/","title":"The price of the most distressing piece of music goes to ..."},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/sp-identity/":{"body":"Arguably one of the most important identities in signal processing is the following theorem.\n\n     \n\nThe identity is known as Moreau’s decomposition and instantiates into useful applications for variational analysis, convex optimization and signal processing.

After around 10 month of regular sessions, I slowly developed enough dexterity to play simple tunes. This post contains a brief resume of observations of the past months and shows some music of the Gambe.\n\nThe Gambe is supported on your legs, has frets and played with a longer convex bow which is played underhand. It has six/seven strings and a differently shaped body than a modern cello. For people, I often describe it as a an intermediate between guitar and cello, but of course it has its own history and developed alongside the violin family.\nI have some experience playing the piano from my teenager years and clarinets from more recent times, but wanted to start a string instrument last year. After listening to J.S. Bach’s Gamba Sonatas, I tried out trial lessons and found out that I really like the repertoire and had a lot of fun practicing the instrument even as a complete beginner.\n\nHugging\nHaving such a large resonating instrument clamped between you, and practicing repetetive tasks for better bowing and fretboard precision, felt very relaxing to me. I really like to play just a few passages in a break and shift my mental focus away from my main task.\n\nNatural playing\nThe instrument resists to be played in haste or agitated state of mind. Instead it can be played most easy when in a natural and relaxed state of body. When I remember back to may teenager years, I worked through emotions on piano, that would not work on a Gambe.\nWhat makes the Gambe especially difficult to play is the required precision in both hands. Similar in function to the frame for dancing, you are connected with the string over the bow by your right hand. Articulations and accentuations are directed by arm falling and tiling of your middle finger.\nWith six or more strings the Gambe resonates quite strongly, and playing strings require high precision of the left hand to keep them freely vibrating when pushing behind the frets. I’m struggling moving hand positions up and down quite a lot.\nCompared to the clarinet, the initial complexity is quite high because of left-right hand coordination and level of precision required. It took me around half a year until I could play the first passage with absolute concentration.\n\nMotor skills and fountain pens\nPlaying passages on the Gambe has an interesting side effect for me. Because it’s so complex in motion, it feels a bit similar to fountain pen writing. In German there is the old proverb “Wer schreibt, der bleibt” (Whoever writes, stays), I came to accept lately. It means that the complex movement of writing helps encoding the written text in your memory. Though of course, not as varied in expression on a fret, playing still improves melody recitation for me.\n\nSome modest progress\n \n      \n        That is a video of me playing a simple dance tune. It is the first melody I can play with some musical accent, though articulation has still a long way to go. But listening to my own recording doesn't feel like total crap :)\n     \n     \n        \n    \n\n\nStudy books\nWe use two books for classes right now. Both contain many tune progression with dedicated chapters on specific techniques. The book by Alison Crum contain 65 solos and describes a new technique or difficulty in plain English below the sheets. Many of them are dancing tunes, for example The New Morris Round, Rigaudon, Rondeau le Badin etc. which are relatively easy and fun to play.\n\n\nSome music with viola da gamba\nHere is some wider range of videos I like with a Gambe\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n","id":"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/viola-da-gamba/","title":"Playing the viol"}},"docInfo":{"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/belle-qui/":{"body":28,"title":2},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/cauchyschwarz-masterclass/":{"body":153,"title":6},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/conmon/":{"body":58,"title":7},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/favorite-choreos/":{"body":64,"title":2},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/favorite-web-vim/":{"body":155,"title":4},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/hd-oranges/":{"body":324,"title":3},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/hello-world/":{"body":98,"title":2},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/i3-mail/":{"body":172,"title":5},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/notes/":{"body":577,"title":4},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/reading-vimhelp/":{"body":419,"title":4},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/recipes/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/recipes/coconut-curry/":{"body":82,"title":2},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/rust-inference/":{"body":344,"title":6},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/self-modifying/":{"body":238,"title":4},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/sombre-song/":{"body":219,"title":5},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/sp-identity/":{"body":88,"title":4},"https://bytesnake.github.io/blog/viola-da-gamba/":{"body":363,"title":2}},"length":18},"lang":"English"}
